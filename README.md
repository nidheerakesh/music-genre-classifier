# AI Music Genre Classifier 🎶

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a complete, end-to-end web application that uses a deep learning model to classify the genre of a music track from an audio file. The application can identify 10 different music genres: blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, and rock.

The core of the project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on spectrograms generated from the GTZAN dataset. The model is served via a Flask API with a simple, clean user interface for uploading audio files and viewing the prediction.

## ✨ Features

-   **Audio Preprocessing:** Automatically converts raw audio files (`.au`) into Mel Spectrogram images.
-   **Deep Learning Model:** A robust CNN architecture trained from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras.
-   **Web Interface:** A simple and intuitive web page to upload an audio file.
-   **Real-time Prediction:** Get an instant genre classification for your uploaded audio.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **Backend:** Python, Flask
-   **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras
-   **Audio & Data Processing:** Librosa, NumPy
-   **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib
-   **Dataset:** GTZAN Genre Collection



## 🔧 Setup and Installation

To run this project locally:

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/music-genre-classifier.git](https://github.com/your-username/music-genre-classifier.git)
cd music-genre-classifier
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install DependenciesThis project uses a requirements.txt file to manage its dependencies.pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: You can generate this file by running pip freeze > requirements.txt in your activated environment.)4. Download the DatasetDownload the GTZAN Genre Collection dataset. You can find it on Kaggle or by searching online.Unzip the file and place the genres_original folder (or genres) inside a data directory in the project root, so the path is data/genres/....🏃‍♀️ How to Use the Application1. Preprocess the DataFirst, you need to convert the raw audio files into spectrograms. Run the preprocessing script:python preprocess.py
This will create a data/spectrograms folder with all the generated images.2. Train the ModelNext, train the CNN model on the spectrograms. This will create the music_genre_classifier.h5 model file.python train.py
(Note: This step can take 10-20 minutes depending on your computer's hardware.)3. Run the Flask ApplicationFinally, start the web server:python app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to use the application.
